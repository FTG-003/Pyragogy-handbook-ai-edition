# 🤖 AI PeerGang v0.1

**PeerGang** is a low-code experimental framework designed to co-create, update, and explore the Peeragogy Handbook using AI Agents.

## 🔍 What is this?

This is version `v0.1`, the very first functional prototype of an AI-powered Peeragogy Agent.  
It uses simple tools (Flowise, Replit, ChromaDB, GitHub Pages) to allow:

- Modular content parsing
- Markdown-based handbook structure
- Flowise AI agents answering questions on specific modules
- Static web viewer for public testing

## 📁 Structure

```
/replit/          → AI simulation backend (mock or real)
/flowise/         → JSON Flowise agents
/ai-handbook/     → Markdown modules of the handbook
/public-viewer/   → Static viewer (HTML)
/docs/            → Documentation
```

## 🎯 First Goal (48h Cycle)

> ✔️ Agent responds to questions from the “Invitation” module  
> ✔️ Static viewer displays test content  
> ✔️ Local mock embedding & AI routing  
> ✔️ All in a clean, modular setup

# Introduction to Peeragogy

Peeragogy is a collection of techniques for collaborative learning and collaborative work. By learning how to "work smart" together, we hope to leave the world in a better state than we found it.

## What is peer learning?

Peer learning is a way of learning that draws on the knowledge and skills of everyone in a group, not just an assigned instructor or teacher. In peer learning, each person takes responsibility not only for their own learning but also for supporting others in their learning journeys.

## The Peeragogy Handbook

The Peeragogy Handbook is a volunteer-created resource for bootstrapping peer learning. It offers practical guidance on how to organize collaborative learning and collaborative work. This AI-enhanced edition builds on the original handbook by incorporating new insights from artificial intelligence to support more effective peer learning experiences.

## Key Principles of Peeragogy

1. **Co-Learning** - Learning together with peers rather than from an authority
2. **Co-Creation** - Building knowledge and resources together
3. **Distributed Leadership** - Sharing responsibility and authority
4. **Authentic Problems** - Working on real-world challenges that matter to participants
5. **Reflection and Iteration** - Continuously improving through feedback and adaptation

## How to Use This Handbook

This handbook is organized into chapters that cover different aspects of peeragogy. Each chapter includes practical advice, examples, and exercises to help you apply peeragogy principles in your own contexts.

As you explore the handbook, we encourage you to:

- Read the chapters that are most relevant to your current needs
- Try out the suggested activities and reflect on your experiences
- Adapt the ideas to fit your specific context
- Share your insights and experiences with others

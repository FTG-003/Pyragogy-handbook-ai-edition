# _chapters/ AI Handbook Content Structure

This folder contains the modular content of the Peeragogy Handbook AI Edition.

- `en-md/`: Markdown version of each chapter (AI-chunkable)
- `en-html/`: Original or styled HTML versions
- Each `.md` file includes front matter for Jekyll and AI metadata

Structure is designed for scalability, multilang support, and AI integration.
